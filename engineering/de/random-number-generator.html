            <p>
                This project involved identifying electrical components and soldering the components to a PCB.
                This created a random number generator that would output a random number, 1-6, as seen on dice.

                <br><u>Goals:</u>
                <br>* Identify all electrical components properly. These included resistors, LEDs, ICs, and switches.
                <br>* Solder all of the components to a PCB without damaging them.
                <br>* Test the randomness of the random number generator.
            </p>

            <span><h1>Develop a Solution</h1></span>
            <p>
                The circuit is soldered correctly and works.
            </p>

                Q: Is this random number generator truly <i>random</i>?
                <br>A: This "random" number generator is not truly random. Ones are favored at 45% distribution,
                while threes only have half of the truly random 16.67% distribution, 8%.
                If this generator were truly random, all numbers 1-6 would have an equal 16.67% chance, which they do not.
                Based on the experience of others with this random number generator, it is likely
                an issue with the ICs themselves that generate the random numbers.

                <br><br>Q: What is the origin of debugging?
                <br>A: "Debugging" is the act of fixing and troubleshooting an issue with electronics or code.
                The term originates from the 1940s when Admiral Grace Hopper found a moth (bug) in
                the Mark II computer at Harvard University. The moth was stuck in a tape,
                which caused the computer program to malfunction. (source: Wikipedia "Debugging")

            <span><h1>Conclusion</h1></span>
            <p>
                In this project, I learned how to use multiple components, including resistors, LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes), capacitors,
                ICs (Integrated Circuits), a slider switch, along with a pushbutton. Resistors, buttons, and switches can be soldered either way,
                but for LEDs and capacitors, polarity matters. For the ICs, I soldered sockets on in the correct direction first to ensure the ICs
                did not get fried with the heat of the soldering iron.
                <br><br>Using proper SI prefixes was also important in the identification of resistors and capacitors, such as kiloohms (kÎ©),
                ohms, and picofarads (pF).
                <br><br>I only encountered two issues during this project. The first issue was that the soldering iron was not hot enough.
                This led me to switch to a different soldering iron. The second issue was that the IC sockets fell off of the PCB when flipped over.
                To solve this issue, I taped the IC sockets to the board so they were stabilized while soldering. I removed the tape afterwords.
                <br><br>As seen in the probability table above, this random number generator is not truly random.
                In the future, I would like to conduct research to find out the cause of this issue and make the
                random number generator more random, and thus fairer.
                <br><br>This random number generator will not be used in board games, as it would be unethical to
                use an unfair generator.
                <br><br>This was a very fun project and a great way to practice my soldering skills!

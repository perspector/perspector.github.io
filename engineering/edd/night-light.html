                The goal of this project was to design and build a night light.
                This included designing and constructing a base, base cover to enclose electronics, and a piece of acrylic to act as a light diffuser.
                LEDs were used to shine light through the underside of a lasercut piece of acrylic.
                This would in turn diffuse the light emitted from the LEDs around a shape that was engraved, or cut partially through, the acrylic.

            </div>
            <p>
                Before I could start designing the base of the night light, I needed to gather some measurements for reference and parts.
                A dial caliper is far superior for accurate and precise when taking small measurements than a ruler since it can measure to more decimal places, can be applied in many different measurement techniques (step, inset, inner diameter, outer diameter, length), and can be calibrated and zeroed.
                For example, the LEDs I used had a diameter of 0.2301 inches. On an imperial dial caliper, the large number represents whole inches, in this case 0 (not included in this measurement but visible further down the length of the caliper).
                Next, look for the smaller numbers along the main body of the dial caliper, in this case 2 (representing 0.2). These represent tenths of decimal inches. To find the hundredths of inches, look on the dial face and find the main marking behind the "hand," in this case 30 exactly (representing 0.030).
                When using scientific or engineering equipment, a standard measurement convention is to estimate to one more decimal place, in this case slightly past the 30 hundredths mark, so about 31 hundredths of an inch.
                This results in a measurement of 0.2301 inches for the diameter of the LED.

                The night light was constructed using a 3D printer, lasercutter, LEDs, resistors, and an old USB cable.

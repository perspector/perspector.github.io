                A Gantt Chart (First Picture) is very helpful in planning a timeline for any project. This helps to ensure that deadlines are met and that time is used effectively. Team responsibilities are also vital to assign in order to ensure effective and productive teamwork. This allows each team member to contribute their strengths, thus increasing the quality of the end result.

            <p>
                In order to determine the most effective filter materials, we tested a variety of materials individually for accurate measurement.
                Aquatic substrate (course <span>sand</span>) filtered quite well as small particles were sifted out during filtering. The issue with using sand for filtering was that some sand could leak through the coffee filter at the bottom, causing an NTU reading of <span>100 NTUs.</span>
                Aquarium <span>gravel</span> filtered based on a similar principle to that of sand and was unable to pass through the filter itself, resulting in a reading of <span>80 NTUs.</span>
                While some materials were forced through the coffee filter, other materials such as <span>thicker cloth</span> and <span>KN-95 masks</span> were inpenetrable by water, even after being soaked for multiple minutes. Even a single layer cut from the mask was unpassible by water. This is likely the case due to the fact that masks are designed to filter out particles from air, which has much smaller particles than water droplets. The cloth may have been too thick or could be synthetic and waterproofed.
                A <span>thicker paper towel</span> resulted in a turbidity reading of <span>135 NTUs</span>, but <span>multiple layers of thinner paper towels proved to be extremely effective.</span>
                We also tested <span>charcoal</span>, but the goal of this project is only to improve water clarity by minimizing turbidity, and charcoal is used only to remove bacteria. In fact, the charcoal resulted in a turbidity of <span>400 NTUs,</span> as it mixed with the water and formed a homogenous mixture. It is possible that we used too much charcoal, did not filter out the charcoal itself, or did not apply the charcoal in its correct state while in our filter.

                Overall, we needed to test multiple designs and iterations of our design in order to obtain an acceptable turbidity.
                Increasing the amount of layers proved to greatly reduce the turbidity. Along with this change, separating layers using cotton balls was also imperative. We also noticed that sand could spill out of the paper towels and bypass a few layers, causing an increase in turbidity of the result sample. To mitigate this issue, we decided to create "DIY coffee filters" by folding a paper towel first in half, and then into a triangle that could be opened up in a funnel/cone-like form. This allowed the water and sand to be directed through each layer of thin paper towels. This technique resulted in a substantial decrease in turbidity from 256.3 NTUs to 137.2 NTUs and later (after rinsing with clean water and recreating the filter using new materials) from 137.2 NTUs to 11.1 NTUs.

            <span><h1>Evaluate Solution</h1></span>
            <p>
                As visible in the table above (in Construct and Test Prototype), we went through multiple iterations of our design. Each time, we improved the design by increasing the amount of layers, rearranging layers from coarse at the top to fine at the bottom, and by creating funnels to reduce the probability of a potential bypass or overflow in any given layer.
            </p>
            <span><h1>Present Solution</h1></span>
            <p>
                Together, Logan and I presented our final water filter design along with test results of materials, observations, and our collective design process. The presentation was given to our class where teams presented observations along with their final design to other teams. The presentation along with this portfolio serve as documentation how to successfully design, construct, and test a filter to reduce water turbidity using only household materials.
            </p>
            <span><h1>Reflection</h1></span>
            <p>
                This project was very informative and allowed me to explore the theoretical and practical aspects of water filters. Logan and I observed that a water filter could be improved by increasing the amount of layers along with starting with filtering out large particles with a hankerchief, gravel, and coarse paper towels. The water was then funneled through finer materials such as sand, thin paper towels, a coffee filter, and cotton to catch any last sedimentary particles. This was possible due to productive and fun teamwork. To further improve the project, I would test more samples and even try reusing the filter after cleaning materials, although this would likely take more time.

            <span><h1>Finding and Justifying a Problem</h1></span>
            <p>
                To begin this project, we needed to find a justifiable problem that impacted many people and could be solved within our semester.
            </p>
            <span><h2>Possible Problems</h2></span>
            <p>
                <span>1. Rip Currents are Difficult to Detect</span>
                <br>Rip currents are dangerous currents close to shore that can pull unaware swimmers out to sea.
                While a few computer programs using neural networks and AI to detect rip currents,
                there are no existing systems that can be widely implemented to detect rip currents.
                <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378383921000193">Existing solutions</a> require specific camera placement,
                immense amounts of data, and are generally not effective enough at this point in time.
                According to the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/">U.S. National Weather Service</a> (Accessed March 19, 2024),
                between 2013 and 2022 there were an average of 53 rip current fatalities per year.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>2. Orthotics in Shoes are Difficult and Expensive to Make</span>
                <br>Many people, such as other runners and myself, start to get "flat feet" where the arches of their feet flatten out over time, resulting in foot pain.
                To resolve this issue, people buy expensive orthotic inserts that are custom made to support your arches when wearing shoes.
                According to <a href="https://www.vivehealth.com/blogs/resources/custom-orthotics-cost">VibeHealth</a>, a health website,
                "The cost of custom orthotics typically ranges between $300 and $600."
                I know from personal experience that these orthotics also take weeks or months to manufacture and ship.
                If 3D printing could be used to make ergonomic orthotics with custom arch support, then these issues would be eliminated.

                <span>3. Many Applications of Drones Require a Specific Drone, But Drones are Expensive</span>
                <br>Drones are used for

                With this many use cases, drones have immensely different form factors for specific uses.
                The issue with drones in their current state is that many different types of drones would be required for multiple missions.
                It would be best to have a single drone that can have attachments for other instruments (cameras, winches, sensors, etc.) for any use case.
                This would appeal to both government entities, as their drones would be ready wherever, whenever, for whatever purpose necessary.
                Modular drones could also be applied to other user groups, such as hobbyists that just want to do as much as possible with the
                hardware they have without spending immense amounts of money.

                <span>4. Guitar is Often Difficult and Frustrating to Learn for Beginners</span>
                <br>When starting to play guitar, many beginners have the dream of playing their favorite song quickly.
                As they begin to learn with simple songs, beginners often become bored.
                Later on, they have trouble remembering the immense amounts of major, minor, bar, seventh chords, and so on.
                This marks the end of most beginners' interest in playing guitar as they become frustrated and quit with self-doubt.
                Fender, a leader in guitar production and education, found that,
                "of the 45 per cent of guitars Fender sold in a year that went to new players;
                90 per cent abandoned the instrument within their first year as a beginner,"
                according to a quote from Fender's CEO Andy Mooney, explained by <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/90-of-beginner-guitar-players-give-up-within-a-year-says-fender">MusicRadar</a>.
                If we could develop a device that helps beginners learn to play chords of their favorite songs on guitar quickly and effectively,
                then we can avoid any self-doubt and rekindle a passion for guitar in many. Playing guitar is also a social activity,
                which can bring many people together and help them make new friends and bring happiness to others.

            <span><h2>Problem Justification Research</h2></span>
            <p>
                As a team, we researched the issue of many beginners giving up on guitar. These are the results we found:
                <br>Source: <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/16-million-americans-learned-to-play-guitar-in-the-last-two-years-why-and-who-are-they-301394808.html">PR Newswire</a> 
                <br>Summary:
                PR Newswire states that, “7% of the U.S. population ages 13-64 started to learn guitar in the last two years.”
                This is a significant customer base showing that there is intense demand for an aid that eases learning to play guitar.
                This percentage equates to approximately 16 million people who are learning to play guitar.
                <br>Critique:
                <br>This article has statistics from Fender, a leader in guitar technology that conducted large research projects
                to determine what guitar players want and need for their commercial advantage.
                This means that they have pinpointed exactly what projects users need, which is advantageous to us, as we can find out exactly what users need using this data.

                <br>Summary:
                <br>Most people who start playing guitar quit alarmingly quickly. Fender is trying to change this, but many beginners still get frustrated and quit.
                The article states, “According to the Fender chief, the company found that of the 45 per cent of guitars Fender sold in a year that went to new players;
                90 per cent abandoned the instrument within their first year as a beginner." 
                <br>Critique:
                This demonstrates a need to interest beginners enough to continue playing the guitar without frustration.
                There is validity in this issue since Fender has invested in improving the user retention of guitar beginners.

                <br>Summary:
                <br>There is an increasing market behind musical instruments, as during COVID-19 many people tried to learn to play a musical instrument.
                According to BBC, the UK's largest online retailer of musical instruments, Gear4music, reported, "a sales growth of 80%." 
                <br>Critique:
                <br>Since there is a large market with a definite need for easing the process of learning an instrument,
                a tool to help beginners learn to play guitar would be beneficial to both consumers and retailers.

            <span><h2>Problem Statement</h2></span>
            <p>
                Almost 10% (715 million) of the world’s population has attempted to learn guitar,
                but only 50 million people play consistently. We believe that this stems from the lack of gratification
                and the immense difficulty of learning to play the guitar well and memorize chords.
                We hope to be able to develop a physical aid of some kind to help new, and even experienced guitar
                players to learn chords and techniques as a way to be able to preform new and interesting songs.
            </p>

            <p>
                During this portion of the capstone project, Logan, Ethan, and I were able to gather over 200 responses for our survey.
                Thus, the survey is representative of what criteria users value most in a tool to help them to learn to play guitar.
                According to our survey, 55.2% of respondents had played guitar before.
                Those who had played guitar before found it most difficult to memorize chords, learn techniques, and play chords.
                They had mostly learned to play from a teacher.
                Teachers can be expensive over time, and if tought during school a teacher may not be able to devote as much attention to individual students.
                We could make a device that would be supplementary to teacher instruction to get beginners started and guide them personally, without having to teach them many specific chords to memorize and play.
                When asked whether they had an interest in playing guitar, 30.8% of the 91 surveyed non-guitar players showed possible interest, citing time and cost as hinderences.
                Additionally, 48.4% of non-guitar players showed definite interest.
                Over one-fourth of those showing definite interest would devote less than an hour per week to playing guitar, while over half would devote one to three hours per week.
                Users generally valued ease of use, cost, and customizability in a guitar learning tool.
                Users also expressed interest in using an application or a physical aid on a guitar as a learning medium.

            <span><p>Summary</p></span>
            <p>This patent is for a device that assists users in learning new stringed instruments, like the electric guitar. It employs a system of indicators to aid the user in determining when and which notes to play, as well as the techniques required to play them. The device uses lights with different colors to help users learn the instrument.</p>
            <span><p>Critique</p></span>
            <p>Learning to play guitar is not an interactive process, in that sheet music does not correct mistakes or indicate the physical location of the notes to play. This patent attempts to solve the latter by introducing a system of lights to guide the user to the correct playing position. The system of lighting and timing works well with learning how to play specific songs, but the device has to be invasively glued to the fretboard, potentially ruining the guitar. This patent adds a creative and visual method to learning guitar, utilizing an on-guitar device.</p>

            <span><p>Critique</p></span>
            <p>This patent attempts to help users learn playing technique, as well as how to read music. By teaching users chords, they can play learn to play songs, providing positive feedback. Additionally, they can gradually develop the calluses needed for playing. The progressive features of the patent make it ideal, where users can reduce their dependence on the device as their skill levels grow. Patent shows how a simple mechanical device can be used to encourage new guitar players to stick with it, as well as demonstrating how removable devices with progression systems are important.</p>

            <p>This patent is for a guitar that has a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) mounted underneath the fingerboard in order to be able to display finger positions. The LCD in theory can be used to display multiple different colors at any position to indicate where the user’s fingers should be placed and what needs to happen fro the proper effect to be achieved.</p>
            <span><p>Critique</p></span>
            <p>This patent solved the problem by clearly showing users what they need to do in certain situations to attempt to help them learn different techniques. The good attributes are that it seems like it would work well in theory, and it seems like it could turn out to be an actually good product. However, when thinking about this product in actuality the LCD would take up the entire neck of the guitar, and thus would likely change the tone, and be incredibly expensive and fragile. Also the entire neck of the guitar would have to be replaced to get the product to work in the desired fashion.</p>

            <p>This product builds muscle memory for the user by allowing them to practice chord positions quickly. The main feature that this product lacks is that there is no sound, so users do not remember chords by ear, only by kinesthetic feeling. The feature of displaying chords close to the finger positions would be beneficial to have in our design.</p>

            <p>This product uses a paper cover to show where fingers should be positioned to play specific chords. A paper insert is placed between the strings and the fretboard which has circles representing finger placement positions.</p>
            <span><p>Critique</p></span>
            <p>This product has chords printed on paper, which is cheap to produce and easy to install. It is also not a permanent attachment to the guitar. However, switching between chords is difficult as the paper inserts must be swapped each time. Additionally, the paper insert may interfere with the strings so that the sound is unpleasant.</p>

            <p>This shows beginners and advanced players alike learn their favorite songs easily. The main issue with this product is that the chord recognition is not perfect and may require some tweaking. There are free and paid versions, and it can be used for free without MIDI exports or more advanced features.</p>


            <span><h1>Potential Market</h1></span>
            <p>
                About 715 million people have attempted to play guitar, but only 50 million actively play. Some 62% of the study participants shared that Covid-19 was an important reason behind starting guitar and 77% say it allowed them to practice more than they would have normally. Additionally, 53% of beginners responded that they spend 2 hours or less practicing a week, but on average, they believe practicing 4 hours a week for 1-2 years is what it will take to “get good” at guitar.

            <span><h2>Summary So Far</h2></span>
            <p>
                We have now found multiple existing products and patents, which we cannot infringe upon. This has showed us what has already been done to solve the issue of beginners having difficulties learning to play guitar. By analyzing these pre-existing solutions, we can now determine what features must be included on our solution and how we can make our design more appealing to users than other designs. It is also interesting to see what patents have been created and were seen as having high potential, versus the products that are actually on the market (patented or unpatented). In this portion of the project, I researched all of the products and helped Ethan and Logan find patents.

            <p>
                In this portion of the capstone project, we brainstormed multiple design requirements which our selected design must fulfill. These will be used in the next part of the design process to eliminate inadequate concepts and decide on the most effective solution, which we will build later. Setting measurable design requirements (specific requirements that can be tested and evaulated logically or using mathematics) ensures that our design must fulfill the requirements and that no "shortcuts" are taken, resulting in a more effective design. By brainstorming these requirements early, we can guide our design process toward the best solution without having to revise our solution as many times later.
                I contributed to this step by analyzing survey results, brainstorming design requirements, and keeping the team on task as a project manager.

                Once we had multiple concept sketches, we decided upon three to include in a user survey. We then questioned twenty people about the three chosen concepts to gather more user data. We explained the details of each concept evenly and then asked interviewees what they liked and disliked about each concept, along with whether they had any improvements to suggest. We also collected their age for age group identification along with for determining customer needs from various age groups.
            </p>
            <span><h2>Concept Survey Summary</h2></span>
            <p>
                Most of the people we surveyed had interest in learning to play or playing guitar. Features they liked about our designs were that they were detachable, non-permanent, and intuitive. Issues with the designs were commonly interference with fingers while playing, cost, and visibility.
                They thought that we should combine the first and third or second and third design. It also must be easily visible when tilting your head to view your fingers and should not fall off easily. Also important was being friendly for beginners, and teaching them proper methods of playing and musical notation.

            <p>
                Our final design is composed of two main components that are clamped to the guitar such as to avoid damaging the instrument. This removable design will also avoid any infringement on playing properly. The first component is an LED matrix (multiple rows and columns of lights) that is attached to the neck of the guitar. This matrix will show the user the positions that their fingers must be placed on the neck. Using different LED colors the user will easily be able to see which fingers are placed on each fret and string to play the appropriate chord. The second component of our design is an OLED display (a small screen) that is attached to the body of the instrument that will be able to prop up for easy viewing. This screen will display additional information about playing the chord or song including the name of the chord and other information such as timing or the next chord. This design will be very helpful in teaching users how to play chords along with their favorite songs early on without frustration. 
            </p>





            <!-- PART E -->
            <span><h1>STEM Concepts</h1></span>
            <p>Each of our decisions relating to the creation of this product is well thought out and requires some element of STEM. The largest of these concepts that is apparent in our design is Technology. We are using a system of electrical components in order to create a system of lights and a screen that will communicate to the user how to play the guitar. This requires some coding, programming, and wiring, which are all technical engineering skills. This is not the only essential part of our design though. Our design has to attach directly to the guitar, and this means that there are several different Engineering components used. We need to figure out how to attach the several components of our design to the guitar such that they are both not causing any harm to the instrument and can be easily removed and reattached, and that they do not cause any major balancing issues when holding the guitar. Because the guitar has a somewhat awkward shape and has a long obtrusion at one end (the neck) that holds the strings for playing and we have to attach things to it, we needed to analyze how much that would have the balancing of the instrument and how this could impact playing could impact playing.
            </p>
            <span><h1>Prototype Stages</h1></span>
            <p>
                We are planning to create our design using a small computer called a Raspberry Pi Zero. This computer has a low-level interface that can be programmed using the Python programming language. Using this interface, called GPIO (General Purpose Input Output pins), along with underlying Python code (gpiozero, Adafruit CircuitPython's neopixel, and luma.oled), we will control a hand-soldered neopixel matrix and an OLED display. A neopixel matrix is an array comprised of five strips of neopixels (super bright color-controlled Light Emitting Diodes), containing eight neopixels each. This will give us an 8x5 matrix, but we will only use it as a 6x5 matrix as common guitars only have six strings. To interface with the OLED display, we will use a protocol called SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) to send commands to the display.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these functions will be combined in a main Python program with possible additional code in another programming language for scraping (gathering) website data for songs from the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for hardware, we will design a custom enclosure for the electronics to be mounted on the neck of the guitar and on the body, containing the neopixel matrix and the OLED display respectively. To create these designs, we will use Autodesk Fusion 360 CAD (Computer Aided Design) software to design the case. Once the design phase is complete, we will either 3D print or lasercut the design, or use a combination of both manufacturing methods.

            <!-- PART F -->
            <span><h1>Design Viability</h1></span>
            <p>
                In this portion of the design process, we needed to determine what conditions our design would be exposed to and how viable the design truly was. We needed to weigh the benefits and the drawbacks of our product. To do this, we also considered the environmental impact that producing, shipping, using, and disposing of our product would have.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Loads</span>
            </p>
            <p>Loads will be static as there will be tension in the design portion that is connected to the neck of the guitar. The design will need to be clamped onto the guitar, and the clamp will have a static load in the form of tension. The lower portion of the design comprised of the OLED display mounted on the guitar body will also be clamped to the guitar to allow easy removal and attachment, so this will also have tension in the clamp.</p>

            <p>
                <span>Materials</span>
            </p>
            <p>We will either lasercut acrylic or some sort of hardwood to construct the outer case. We may also use 3D printing in the design, whichever option we decide on later. These materials will be more than strong enough together with a thoughtfully designed product that it will be resilient to any small drops or swinging it around on the guitar. We will also add strain relief or connectors for wires exiting the enclosures to ensure that they do not fray or break. Our design will only be mounted on a guitar, so it will not experience many loads. The design will also be able to clamp onto a guitar neck and guitar body, so repetitive loading will be withstood through a clamp release mechanism which will be thoroughly tested. There will not be any extreme temperatures expected for this design to operate in. PLA plastic does deteriorate very slowly when exposed to UV light, but we know that PLA designs have withstood harsh conditions (previous project from Benny, designing a waterproof radio antenna case for outside use, it still works).</p>

            <p>
                <span>Mechanical Engineering</span>
            </p>
            <p>No heat or mechanical power is required. No moving parts or simple machines will be used. All components should interact effectively because none will be moving w/out external input from user. Loads should not be transferred except in the case of rapid catastrophic deconstruction. All parts should move at an ideal speed of 0m/s (so the product is at rest).</p>

            <p>
                <span>Energy</span>
            </p>
            <p>Electronics components require electricity, supplied by a battery. Chemical energy in the battery is converted into electrical energy and transferred through wires.</p>

            <p>
                <span>Chemical/Bio-Engineering</span>
            </p>
            <p>Hazardous chemicals will unfortunately be used in the production of the electronic circuit boards, as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid are used to etch copper traces on PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards).</p>

            <p>
                <span>Electrical Engineering</span>
            </p>
            <p>Electronics used to coordinate and display information. LEDs, wiring, an OLED display, and a Raspberry Pi Zero are all used. They will be integrated using laser-cut mounts.</p>

            <p>
                <span>Laws, Codes, and Regulations</span>
            </p>
            <p>The only relevent legal issue we could find was the disposal of batteries as hazardous waste. These can be disposed of through municipal programs and local stores, which then transport them to recycling centers. Our team also meets the ethical responsility for technical expertise related to our product design.</p>

            <span><h2>Summary So Far</h2></span>
            <p>During this stage, I helped with analyzing the true environmental impact of the Chordinator. It is astonishing how much energy is required for the production of a product, from harvesting raw materials during the premanufacture stage to chemical treatment when a product is disposed of. It is absolutely imperative that engineers consider the lifecycle of a product as every engineer should strive to reduce any negative impacts that production has on the environment. Lithium-ion batteries are extremely dangerous for the environment, can poisen entire rivers, and are recycled through unsafe practices and child labor. All of our electronics now use PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards), which are comprised of a mixture of glass and resin along with copper trace layers. Copper is mined by using open-pit mines, strip-mines or mountaintop removal, where entire mountaintops are leveled and landscapes are destroyed. Engineers must have ethical considerations for the environment and humanity worldwide as small design choices may have a long-lasting impact on the world. The IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers) has a <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html">Code of Ethics</a> that aligns to my belief of what "being ethical" truly means.</p>
            <p>The IEEE Code of Ethics emphasizes the following concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring the safety, health, and welfare of the public</li>
                <li>Developing sustainably</li>
                <li>Protecting privacy</li>
                <li>Disclosing dangers immediately</li>
                <li>Improve general knowledge of technology</li>
                <li>Avoid and disclose conflict, obey laws, and reject bribery</li>
                <li>To accept and seek honest criticism of work and to correct errors</li>
                <li>To give accurate and honest claims based upon data</li>
                <li>To credit others properly</li>
                <li>Know your technical knowledge and limits, and ensure others do too. Be honest!</li>
                <li>To treat all people fairly and to respect all and to never discriminate against others</li>
                <li>Never harass anyone</li>
                <li>Never injure others, property, reputation, or employment</li>
                <li>To ensure that this code of ethics is upheld by others</li>
                <li>Never retaliate against individuals reporting violations of this code</li>
            </ul>

            <span><h1>Additional Documentation</h1></span>
            <p>We used Autodesk Fusion to create the designs for the top and bottom parts of the Chordinator. Then, we 3D printed these parts using an FDM 3D printer.</p>
            <p>Tolerances are difficult to determine with 3D printing, as pieces can be slightly different between prints. Despite this, Logan was able to create a hinge that lets the user "prop up" the display on the lower part of the Chordinator. Additionally, I designed the top part (neck attachment) of the Chordinator. This part required using a compliant mechanism that uses the tension of the 3D printed PLA plastic to "clip" onto a guitar neck. Two test prints were required to acquire the correct tolerance, and we later applied foam tape to the parts as to provide more static friction while mounted on the guitar so it would not slide off. The foam tape also ensured that the guitar would not sustain any damage from the application of our device.</p>
            <p>After adjusting tolerances and 3D printing the final parts, we affixed the electronics (neopixel strips and OLED display) to the case parts using hot glue, which keeps them securely in place and insulates any circuits safely. This can also provide strain relief to any external wires so they do not fray. Once the electronics were mounted inside the case, we could connect the wires shown in the schematic below to interface the neopixel strips and the OLED display with the Raspberry Pi Zero.</p>
            <p>At this time, I realized that I had made the wires connecting the neck attachment and the body attachment of the Chordinator too short. Therefore, I soldered some extension wires to allow the parts to be mounted further apart. I ensured the extension wires were made using stranded wires, so current loss would be minimal, though the distance was less than half a meter.</p>
            <p>Once the parts could be connected, I also lasercut a cover for the neopixel LEDs using our school lasercutter and dark, matte acrylic. This turned out to work exceptionally well, as seen in the image below.</p>
            <p>After the physical device was complete, I spent seven hours on a rainy Saturday writing a web scraper program that would take song chord data from https://freetar.de (a frontend website for https://ultimate-guitar.com). This gave us access to the largest guitar song and chord repository worldwide, Ultimate Guitar. Now we could load over 500,000 songs onto the Chordinator, just by inputing the song name into the program!</p>
            <p>I am releasing the code for the Chordinator as open-source under the GNU GPLv3 Affero License. Code for the Chordinator is available <a href="https://github.com/perspector/chordinator">here.</a></p>

            <span><h1>Finding and Justifying a Problem</h1></span>
            <p>
                To begin this project, we needed to find a justifiable problem that impacted many people and could be solved within our semester.
            </p>
            <span><h2>Possible Problems</h2></span>
            <p>
                <span>1. Rip Currents are Difficult to Detect</span>
                <br>Rip currents are dangerous currents close to shore that can pull unaware swimmers out to sea.
                While a few computer programs using neural networks and AI to detect rip currents,
                there are no existing systems that can be widely implemented to detect rip currents.
                <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378383921000193">Existing solutions</a> require specific camera placement,
                immense amounts of data, and are generally not effective enough at this point in time.
                According to the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/">U.S. National Weather Service</a> (Accessed March 19, 2024),
                between 2013 and 2022 there were an average of 53 rip current fatalities per year.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>2. Orthotics in Shoes are Difficult and Expensive to Make</span>
                <br>Many people, such as other runners and myself, start to get "flat feet" where the arches of their feet flatten out over time, resulting in foot pain.
                To resolve this issue, people buy expensive orthotic inserts that are custom made to support your arches when wearing shoes.
                According to <a href="https://www.vivehealth.com/blogs/resources/custom-orthotics-cost">VibeHealth</a>, a health website,
                "The cost of custom orthotics typically ranges between $300 and $600."
                I know from personal experience that these orthotics also take weeks or months to manufacture and ship.
                If 3D printing could be used to make ergonomic orthotics with custom arch support, then these issues would be eliminated.

                <span>3. Many Applications of Drones Require a Specific Drone, But Drones are Expensive</span>
                <br>Drones are used for

                With this many use cases, drones have immensely different form factors for specific uses.
                The issue with drones in their current state is that many different types of drones would be required for multiple missions.
                It would be best to have a single drone that can have attachments for other instruments (cameras, winches, sensors, etc.) for any use case.
                This would appeal to both government entities, as their drones would be ready wherever, whenever, for whatever purpose necessary.
                Modular drones could also be applied to other user groups, such as hobbyists that just want to do as much as possible with the
                hardware they have without spending immense amounts of money.

                <span>4. Guitar is Often Difficult and Frustrating to Learn for Beginners</span>
                <br>When starting to play guitar, many beginners have the dream of playing their favorite song quickly.
                As they begin to learn with simple songs, beginners often become bored.
                Later on, they have trouble remembering the immense amounts of major, minor, bar, seventh chords, and so on.
                This marks the end of most beginners' interest in playing guitar as they become frustrated and quit with self-doubt.
                Fender, a leader in guitar production and education, found that,
                "of the 45 per cent of guitars Fender sold in a year that went to new players;
                90 per cent abandoned the instrument within their first year as a beginner,"
                according to a quote from Fender's CEO Andy Mooney, explained by <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/90-of-beginner-guitar-players-give-up-within-a-year-says-fender">MusicRadar</a>.
                If we could develop a device that helps beginners learn to play chords of their favorite songs on guitar quickly and effectively,
                then we can avoid any self-doubt and rekindle a passion for guitar in many. Playing guitar is also a social activity,
                which can bring many people together and help them make new friends and bring happiness to others.

            <span><h2>Problem Justification Research</h2></span>
            <p>
                As a team, we researched the issue of many beginners giving up on guitar. These are the results we found:
                <br>Source: <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/16-million-americans-learned-to-play-guitar-in-the-last-two-years-why-and-who-are-they-301394808.html">PR Newswire</a> 
                <br>Summary:
                PR Newswire states that, “7% of the U.S. population ages 13-64 started to learn guitar in the last two years.”
                This is a significant customer base showing that there is intense demand for an aid that eases learning to play guitar.
                This percentage equates to approximately 16 million people who are learning to play guitar.
                <br>Critique:
                <br>This article has statistics from Fender, a leader in guitar technology that conducted large research projects
                to determine what guitar players want and need for their commercial advantage.
                This means that they have pinpointed exactly what projects users need, which is advantageous to us, as we can find out exactly what users need using this data.

                <br>Summary:
                <br>Most people who start playing guitar quit alarmingly quickly. Fender is trying to change this, but many beginners still get frustrated and quit.
                The article states, “According to the Fender chief, the company found that of the 45 per cent of guitars Fender sold in a year that went to new players;
                90 per cent abandoned the instrument within their first year as a beginner." 
                <br>Critique:
                This demonstrates a need to interest beginners enough to continue playing the guitar without frustration.
                There is validity in this issue since Fender has invested in improving the user retention of guitar beginners.

                <br>Summary:
                <br>There is an increasing market behind musical instruments, as during COVID-19 many people tried to learn to play a musical instrument.
                According to BBC, the UK's largest online retailer of musical instruments, Gear4music, reported, "a sales growth of 80%." 
                <br>Critique:
                <br>Since there is a large market with a definite need for easing the process of learning an instrument,
                a tool to help beginners learn to play guitar would be beneficial to both consumers and retailers.

            <span><h2>Problem Statement</h2></span>
            <p>
                Almost 10% (715 million) of the world’s population has attempted to learn guitar,
                but only 50 million people play consistently. We believe that this stems from the lack of gratification
                and the immense difficulty of learning to play the guitar well and memorize chords.
                We hope to be able to develop a physical aid of some kind to help new, and even experienced guitar
                players to learn chords and techniques as a way to be able to preform new and interesting songs.
            </p>

            <p>
                During this portion of the capstone project, Logan, Ethan, and I were able to gather over 200 responses for our survey.
                Thus, the survey is representative of what criteria users value most in a tool to help them to learn to play guitar.
                According to our survey, 55.2% of respondents had played guitar before.
                Those who had played guitar before found it most difficult to memorize chords, learn techniques, and play chords.
                They had mostly learned to play from a teacher.
                Teachers can be expensive over time, and if tought during school a teacher may not be able to devote as much attention to individual students.
                We could make a device that would be supplementary to teacher instruction to get beginners started and guide them personally, without having to teach them many specific chords to memorize and play.
                When asked whether they had an interest in playing guitar, 30.8% of the 91 surveyed non-guitar players showed possible interest, citing time and cost as hinderences.
                Additionally, 48.4% of non-guitar players showed definite interest.
                Over one-fourth of those showing definite interest would devote less than an hour per week to playing guitar, while over half would devote one to three hours per week.
                Users generally valued ease of use, cost, and customizability in a guitar learning tool.
                Users also expressed interest in using an application or a physical aid on a guitar as a learning medium.

            <span><p>Summary</p></span>
            <p>This patent is for a device that assists users in learning new stringed instruments, like the electric guitar. It employs a system of indicators to aid the user in determining when and which notes to play, as well as the techniques required to play them. The device uses lights with different colors to help users learn the instrument.</p>
            <span><p>Critique</p></span>
            <p>Learning to play guitar is not an interactive process, in that sheet music does not correct mistakes or indicate the physical location of the notes to play. This patent attempts to solve the latter by introducing a system of lights to guide the user to the correct playing position. The system of lighting and timing works well with learning how to play specific songs, but the device has to be invasively glued to the fretboard, potentially ruining the guitar. This patent adds a creative and visual method to learning guitar, utilizing an on-guitar device.</p>

            <p>This patent is for a guitar that has a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) mounted underneath the fingerboard in order to be able to display finger positions. The LCD in theory can be used to display multiple different colors at any position to indicate where the user’s fingers should be placed and what needs to happen fro the proper effect to be achieved.</p>
            <span><p>Critique</p></span>
            <p>This patent solved the problem by clearly showing users what they need to do in certain situations to attempt to help them learn different techniques. The good attributes are that it seems like it would work well in theory, and it seems like it could turn out to be an actually good product. However, when thinking about this product in actuality the LCD would take up the entire neck of the guitar, and thus would likely change the tone, and be incredibly expensive and fragile. Also the entire neck of the guitar would have to be replaced to get the product to work in the desired fashion.</p>

            <span><p>Critique</p></span>
            <p>This product has chords printed on paper, which is cheap to produce and easy to install. It is also not a permanent attachment to the guitar. However, switching between chords is difficult as the paper inserts must be swapped each time. Additionally, the paper insert may interfere with the strings so that the sound is unpleasant.</p>

            <span><p>Summary</p></span>
            <p>This is a website and an app that takes a youtube music video and shows what chords are used. The finger placement of the chords is also depicted on the website in an intuitive interface. This lets people understand how to play their favorite songs easily without the need for other tutorials.</p>
            <span><p>Critique</p></span>
            <p>This shows beginners and advanced players alike learn their favorite songs easily. The main issue with this product is that the chord recognition is not perfect and may require some tweaking. There are free and paid versions, and it can be used for free without MIDI exports or more advanced features.</p>


            <span><h1>Potential Market</h1></span>
            <p>
                About 715 million people have attempted to play guitar, but only 50 million actively play. Some 62% of the study participants shared that Covid-19 was an important reason behind starting guitar and 77% say it allowed them to practice more than they would have normally. Additionally, 53% of beginners responded that they spend 2 hours or less practicing a week, but on average, they believe practicing 4 hours a week for 1-2 years is what it will take to “get good” at guitar.
                <br>Statistics are from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesscording/2022/06/24/study-shows-16-million-people-learned-to-play-guitar-during-the-first-two-years-of-the-pandemic/?sh=484750095400">Forbes/Fender</a>.

            <span><h2>Summary So Far</h2></span>
            <p>
                We have now found multiple existing products and patents, which we cannot infringe upon. This has showed us what has already been done to solve the issue of beginners having difficulties learning to play guitar. By analyzing these pre-existing solutions, we can now determine what features must be included on our solution and how we can make our design more appealing to users than other designs. It is also interesting to see what patents have been created and were seen as having high potential, versus the products that are actually on the market (patented or unpatented). In this portion of the project, I researched all of the products and helped Ethan and Logan find patents.

            <p>
                In this portion of the capstone project, we brainstormed multiple design requirements which our selected design must fulfill. These will be used in the next part of the design process to eliminate inadequate concepts and decide on the most effective solution, which we will build later. Setting measurable design requirements (specific requirements that can be tested and evaulated logically or using mathematics) ensures that our design must fulfill the requirements and that no "shortcuts" are taken, resulting in a more effective design. By brainstorming these requirements early, we can guide our design process toward the best solution without having to revise our solution as many times later.
                I contributed to this step by analyzing survey results, brainstorming design requirements, and keeping the team on task as a project manager.

            </div>
            <p>
                Once we had multiple concept sketches, we decided upon three to include in a user survey. We then questioned twenty people about the three chosen concepts to gather more user data. We explained the details of each concept evenly and then asked interviewees what they liked and disliked about each concept, along with whether they had any improvements to suggest. We also collected their age for age group identification along with for determining customer needs from various age groups.
            </p>
            <span><h2>Concept Survey Summary</h2></span>
            <p>
                Most of the people we surveyed had interest in learning to play or playing guitar. Features they liked about our designs were that they were detachable, non-permanent, and intuitive. Issues with the designs were commonly interference with fingers while playing, cost, and visibility.
                They thought that we should combine the first and third or second and third design. It also must be easily visible when tilting your head to view your fingers and should not fall off easily. Also important was being friendly for beginners, and teaching them proper methods of playing and musical notation.
            </p>
            <span><h1>Final Design Decision Matrix</h1></span>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="capstone40.webp" alt="Final design decision matrix">

            <span><h1>Final Design Sketch</h1></span>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="capstone41.webp" alt="Final design sketch">
            </div>
            <p>
                Our final design is composed of two main components that are clamped to the guitar such as to avoid damaging the instrument. This removable design will also avoid any infringement on playing properly. The first component is an LED matrix (multiple rows and columns of lights) that is attached to the neck of the guitar. This matrix will show the user the positions that their fingers must be placed on the neck. Using different LED colors the user will easily be able to see which fingers are placed on each fret and string to play the appropriate chord. The second component of our design is an OLED display (a small screen) that is attached to the body of the instrument that will be able to prop up for easy viewing. This screen will display additional information about playing the chord or song including the name of the chord and other information such as timing or the next chord. This design will be very helpful in teaching users how to play chords along with their favorite songs early on without frustration.

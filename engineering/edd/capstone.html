            <span><h1>Finding and Justifying a Problem</h1></span>
            <p>
                To begin this project, we needed to find a justifiable problem that impacted many people and could be solved within our semester.
                Some of the problems we brainstormed were:
            </p>
            <span><h2>Possible Problems</h2></span>
            <p>
                <span>1. Rip Currents are Difficult to Detect</span>
                <br>Rip currents are dangerous currents close to shore that can pull unaware swimmers out to sea.
                While a few computer programs using neural networks and AI to detect rip currents,
                there are no existing systems that can be widely implemented to detect rip currents.
                <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378383921000193">Existing solutions</a> require specific camera placement,
                immense amounts of data, and are generally not effective enough at this point in time.
                According to the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/">U.S. National Weather Service</a> (Accessed March 19, 2024),
                between 2013 and 2022 there were an average of 53 rip current fatalities per year.

                <span>2. Orthotics in Shoes are Difficult and Expensive to Make</span>
                <br>Many people, such as other runners and myself, start to get "flat feet" where the arches of their feet flatten out over time, resulting in foot pain.
                To resolve this issue, people buy expensive orthotic inserts that are custom made to support your arches when wearing shoes.
                According to <a href="https://www.vivehealth.com/blogs/resources/custom-orthotics-cost">VibeHealth</a>, a health website,
                "The cost of custom orthotics typically ranges between $300 and $600."
                I know from personal experience that these orthotics also take weeks or months to manufacture and ship.
                If 3D printing could be used to make ergonomic orthotics with custom arch support, then these issues would be eliminated.

                <span>3. Many Applications of Drones Require a Specific Drone, But Drones are Expensive</span>
                <br>Drones are used for

                <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/whcmsc/science/aerial-imaging-and-mapping">aerial mapping</a>.
                With this many use cases, drones have immensely different form factors for specific uses.
                The issue with drones in their current state is that many different types of drones would be required for multiple missions.
                It would be best to have a single drone that can have attachments for other instruments (cameras, winches, sensors, etc.) for any use case.
                This would appeal to both government entities, as their drones would be ready wherever, whenever, for whatever purpose necessary.
                Modular drones could also be applied to other user groups, such as hobbyists that just want to do as much as possible with the
                hardware they have without spending immense amounts of money.

                <span>4. Guitar is Often Difficult and Frustrating to Learn for Beginners</span>
                <br>When starting to play guitar, many beginners have the dream of playing their favorite song quickly.
                As they begin to learn with simple songs, beginners often become bored.
                Later on, they have trouble remembering the immense amounts of major, minor, bar, seventh chords, and so on.
                This marks the end of most beginners' interest in playing guitar as they become frustrated and quit with self-doubt.
                Fender, a leader in guitar production and education, found that,
                "of the 45 per cent of guitars Fender sold in a year that went to new players;
                90 per cent abandoned the instrument within their first year as a beginner,"
                according to a quote from Fender's CEO Andy Mooney, explained by <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/90-of-beginner-guitar-players-give-up-within-a-year-says-fender">MusicRadar</a>.
                If we could develop a device that helps beginners learn to play chords of their favorite songs on guitar quickly and effectively,
                then we can avoid any self-doubt and rekindle a passion for guitar in many. Playing guitar is also a social activity,
                which can bring many people together and help them make new friends and bring happiness to others.

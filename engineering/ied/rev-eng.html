            <p>
                <u>Pros:</u>
                <br>* Propellors are dull and will not cut you.
                <br>* A weighted rod is on the top which will provide balance.
                <br>* It has an on/off power button.
                <br>* A distance sensor is used to make it not crash into the ground.
                <br>* When you plug it in, a status LED shows whether it is charged or not charged through the shell. (red=charging)
                <br><u>Cons:</u>
                <br>* Does not look high quality
                <br>* The power cable could easily be twisted and break.
                <br>* The battery does not last long.
                <br>* Distance sensor will make it hard to catch while flying.
                <br>* Spherical design so it cannot stand up by itself.

                <u>Front View</u>
                <br>This view shows a point on the top of the axle over the propellor. The design on the front under the eyes is made up of lines.
                The color scheme is made up of mostly white, black and gray. The blue part of the eyes is made up of different values to provide contrast.
                The main body is made in a spherical form. The black area around the eyes creates positive space for the eyes. The entire texture is smooth.
                This also represents economy since they only used one texture for the entire model. The design represents balance since it is symmetrical.
                There is emphasis on the blue eyes since they stand out against the black.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Right Side View</u>
                <br>The design of the right side is in the shape of two cocentric circles. The propellors represent rhythm since their form is repeated.
                The cocentric circles are also proportional since they are cocentric.
                The moulding did not work perfectly though, the parts are not lined up correctly.
                The design represents unity as it is mostly gray. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Bottom View</u>
                <br>Writing "CHARGE" would have not fit, so the designers decided to just use "CHA". This represents economy.
                The spherical form also represents economy since there are no complex ridges.
                There are not feet or structures to stand it up on, you just hold it in your hand, which also represents economy.
                If more material were used, it might not fly.

                <br>* Power cut-off so battery lasts longer
                <br>* Feet or rails on the bottom so it can stand up
                <br>* randomness in the circuit making it more interesting
                <br>* Remote control to actually control it more
                <br>* more sensors so it can move sideways
                <br>* Lights on the inside, fly at night (and cooler!)
                <br>* Stronger plastic
                <br>* Replacement propellers
                <br>* Camera so you can see what it "sees"
                <br>* Larger battery (everything scaled up) so it flies longer
                <br>* Better airfoil so it is more efficient

                <u>Rails on the bottom so it can stand up</u>
                <br>The rails will just be little cylinders on the bottom which make it so the heli ball can just stand up and takeoff by itself.
                This will eliminate the need to hold it while takeoff. There will be less injuries.
                <br><u>Joystick and receiver inside heli ball to control it</u>
                <br>This would make the heli ball much more interesting! It would also be safer since people would have more control over it.
                It might decrease the amount of crashes.
                People could turn it around and prevent a crash before it crashes and possibly breaks or breaks something else.
                <br><u>Camera and transmitter</u>
                <br>This would be a lot more fun! It could also be safer since people could see something more easily. This could be used to prevent crashes.

                <u>Advertisement: The Ultra Heli Ball</u>
                <br><u>By Benjamin Chase</u>
                <br>Have you ever had one of those floating heli balls? You put your hand under it, and it flies up. Take your hand away, and it drifts down.
                Sounds fun, right? Not for long. It gets boring pretty soon. But with the Ultra Heli Ball, you will never run out of fun!
                Our newest design features and innovative joystick which lets you control the Ultra Heli Ball with ease. No more watching it go up and down.
                Now you can fly it around! You can even race friends!
                And remember those times when you had to make it takeoff from your hand?
                Our new design is safer than ever since it has innovative rails on the bottom, letting you takeoff from any flat surface. Ready for takeoff!
                But what if the heli ball flies into the next room?
                (insert scene with heli ball flying into another room, someone screams and paper flies out the door the heli ball came through)
                No more calling for matay with the new Ultra Heli Ball!
                The Ultra Heli Ball includes a powerful responsive camera letting you see your flight from bird's eye view.
                You can also use it for racing around the house!
                You will have endless fun with the new Ultra Heli Ball! Get yours today at (insert website here)!
                <br><br>(Quick warning at the end: Be safe, observe FAA regulations and guidelines)

                Shown above are comparisons between measured lift and drag (lbs) at various angles of attack.
                Additionally, measured lift to drag ratios at various angles of attack and their respective
                simulated values are also shown.
            </p>
            <p>
                These results show a direct corellation between similar lift to drag ratios of the tests
                and simulations at higher angles of attack.
                The lift to drag ratio approaches 4.0 for both the measured and the simulated values as
                the angle of attack increases to positive 20 degrees.
                Conversely, the measured results show a gradual increase in lift to drag ratio from
                negative 20 degrees to 0 degrees, while the simulation shows negative ratios
                from -20 to -10 degrees AOA, but sharply increases to 7.8 at -5 degrees AOA.
                This could be due to issues in the construction of the airfoil or
                inaccuracy while testing the airfoil using the wind tunnel and load cell.

            <span><h1>Conclusion</h1></span>

            <p>
                During this project, I learned how to design an airfoil and export its geometry into Excel.
                Then, I learned how to import the points into Autodesk Inventor accurately and how to connect them smoothly using a spline.
                Additionally, I learned how to use a hot wire to cut foam accurately and precisely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next time, I would like to experiment with different types of airfoils and different chord and thickness parameters.
                It would also be very interesting to see how my airfoil design compares in terms of performance
                with the Seling S1223 airfoil I based it on.
                Also, before 3D printing other airfoils, I would print multiple calibration models and potentially redesign the airfoil
                to reduce the thickness of the trailing edge from printing. This would help to maintain the realistic scale of the model
                to a full-size airfoil.

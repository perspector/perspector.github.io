                Model rockets are small solid rocket fuel propelled rockets that can be built at home or in school.
                These model rockets have multiple stages of flight, including launch, rapid ascent, short glide, ejection, slow descent, and recovery.
                A model rocket has a body (the main tube), a launch lug to stabilize the launch, fins to stabilize flight, an engine mount to hold the engine in place, a nose cone for reduced drag, and a parachute or other high drag system to slow the rocket down for a safe descent and recovery.

            <p>
                The goal of this project was to design and build a model rocket that could achieve a very high apogee, or maximum height.
                As a result of this requirement, the rocket needed to be both aerodynamic and stable.
                I chose a small, pointed nose cone and short body since decreased surface area also decreases drag.
                This allows the rocket to fly faster with the same amount of thrust, thus increasing the apogee.
                In addition, the fins needed to be small to reduce drag, but to an extent as a lack of fin surface area would cause instability.
                To allow for multiple tests, the fins also needed to withstand multiple landings.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the design phase, I had to overcome multiple challenges.
                The fins needed to have optimal dimensions.
                Along with this aspect of the design, the body could have a minimum length of 7 inches.
                While having a low body length decreases drag which causes an increase in the apogee,
                a body lenth too small can result in the parachute burning from the heat of the engine.
                If the parachute is too close to the engine, not as much wadding paper can be inserted, and the parachute can burn.
                To balance the criteria of having a high apogee and ensuring the safety of the recovery system, I chose to create a 9 inch long body.

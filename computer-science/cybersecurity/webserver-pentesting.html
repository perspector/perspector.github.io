            <span><h1>Project Objective</h1></span>
            <p>
                This project followed the scenario described below:
            </p>
            <p>
                A company specializing in retailing bicycles, snowboards, and other outdoor active gear has a new e-commerce website.
                The name of the ompany is "Bikes, Boards, and Beyond."
                They need to ensure that the website and webserver are secure against multiple attacks to ensure that their business is secure.
                Their website includes a Retrieve Order page and Message Board page.
            </p>

            <h1>Network Topology</h1>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting1.webp" alt="Proposed network topology">
            </div>
            <p>
                This is my proposed network topology for Bikes, Boards, and Beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                The webserver should be publicly available, so it is connected to the internet with only one router behind a firewall.
                The firewall is necessary since some ports (such as SSH) should probably not be enabled.
            </p>
            <p>
                The customer data server should not be directly connected to the internet, it should be behind the webserver.
                However, the customer data server must be connected to the webserver as shipping and account information must be stored automatically from the website.
                However, this sensitive data should not be stored on the webserver, as the webserver has ports such as HTTPS and FTP open and is thus more vulnerable to attack.
                The data should be secured on the internal Bikes, Boards, and Beyond customer data server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Access computers are needed for accessing the databases on the individual server systems.
                These access computers are needed to modify information from Bikes, Boards, and Beyond.
                They must be internal as they have direct access to the internal servers with only a firewall in between.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that the employee data should be stored offline, as this data does not need high availability.
                Employee data should not be accessible online, which makes it much more difficult to access.
                For Bikes, Boards, and Beyond, employees are likely not working online and systems do not need access to their data from outside the Bikes, Boards, and Beyond internal network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each server has a backup server (represented by the two servers with arrows between them).
                In case one server fails, the other server can take the network load.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, customers do not connect directly to the Bikes, Boards, and Beyond servers.
                They should connect their personal computers from a home network through a firewall and a router, and then connect to a DNS (Domain Name Server) server.
                This DNS server then gives the customer's personal computer the IP address of the Bikes, Boards, and Beyond webserver,
                which can then be accessed over the internet through a Bikes, Boards, and Beyond router and firewall for safety.
            </p>

            <h1><span>Plan of Action</span></h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Determine the IP address of the webserver</li>
                <li>Use the netstat command in PowerShell using the server's IP address to determine the services running on the webserver. These may include SMTP or FTP which may be vulnerable.</li>
                <li>Login to the Bikes, Boards, and Beyond website using the provided credentials (admin/password)</li>
                <li>Explore the website and attempt forceful directory browsing</li>
                <li>Attempt to find logfiles which may contain sensitive data</li>
                <li>If FTP is enabled, attempt to use FTP with found credentials</li>
                <li>Perform cross-site scripting (XSS) on all forms</li>
                <li>Perform SQL injection on all forms</li>
                <li>Attempt a ping flood attack on the webserver</li>
                <li>Attempt remote code execution on all forms</li>
                <li>Secure the webserver by disabling unnecessary features, enabling the firewall, and choosing more secure settings. I will use the IIS (Internet Information Services) Manager on the webserver for this.</li>
            </ol>


            <h1><span>Determine Running Services</span></h1>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting2.webp" alt="Using netstat to determine running services.">
            </div>
            <p>
                I ran netstat â€“an 172.30.0.15 on the webserver, I was able to determine which ports were open.
                Port 21 (FTP) was open, but port 25 (SMTP) was closed (not in the list).
                This means that FTP is running but SMTP is not running.
                FTP stands for the File Transfer Protocol, and is used for transferring files.
                SMTP is a vulnerable mail service (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). 
            </p>


            <h1><span>No Vulnerability:</span> SMTP</h1>
            <p>
                Since port 25 is closed, SMTP is not being used. Thus, SMTP is not a vulnerability.
            </p>


            <h1><span>Vulnerability:</span> Forceful Directory Browsing</h1>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting3.webp" alt="Forceful directory browsing">
            </div>
            <p>
                I attempted forceful directory browsing, and succeeded at browsing directories.
                Forceful directory browsing is when an attacker accesses an unlisted URL of a website, in this case the root URL of the webserver.
            </p>
            <h2>Preventing the Vulnerability</h2>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting4.webp" alt="Disabling directory browsing">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting5.webp" alt="Directory browsing is disabled">
            </div>
            <p>
                Directory browsing was enabled in the IIS Manager, so I disabled it.
            </p>


            <h1><span>Vulnerability:</span> Visible Logfiles</h1>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting6.webp" alt="Logfile contents">
            </div>
            <p>
                Logfiles were visible and could be downloaded through forceful directory browsing.
                One logfile contained a username and password for FTP (anonymous/test).
            </p>
            <h2>Preventing the Vulnerability</h2>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting7.webp" alt="Vulnerable logfile location">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting8.webp" alt="Safer logfile location">
            </div>
            <p>
                To prevent this vulnerability, the directory browsing needed to be disabled, and the logfile location needed to be changed.
                The default storage location for logfiles on the IIS server is in C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles, which is easy for an attacker to guess.
                The logfile location should be changed to outside the inetpub folder in a hard-to-guess location so it cannot be accessed with directory browsing.
            </p>


            <h1><span>Vulnerability:</span> Anonymous FTP</h1>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting9.webp" alt="Successful FileZilla FTP transfer">
            </div>
            <p>
                Using FileZilla, I was able to use anonymous FTP with credentials "anonymous" and "test" found in the logfile.
                Sensitive files were visible on the webserver using FTP. Files could also be uploaded and downloaded from the webserver.
            </p>
            <h2>Preventing the Vulnerability</h2>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting10.webp" alt="FTP Server was enabled">
            </div>
            <p>
                The webserver does not need FTP enabled, so it would be significantly more secure to disable FTP.
                To disable FTP, I used the Windows Server Manager's Remove Roles and Features Wizard, where I unchecked "FTP Server."
            </p>


            <h1><span>Vulnerability:</span> XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)</h1>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting11.webp" alt="XSS on the Retrieve Order page">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting12.webp" alt="XSS on the Message Board page">
            </div>
            <p>
                Cross-site scripting (XSS) is when an attacker uses Javascript code as input into a form.
                If not configured properly, the input will indeed be interpreted as Javascript, and will run on the client's web browser.
                In this scenario, I used Javascript code that showed a heading confirming a successful XSS attempt.
            </p>
            <h2>Preventing the Vulnerability</h2>
            <div class="design-process-image-box">
                <img src="webserver-pentesting13.webp" alt="Detection of XSS in Wireshark">
            </div>
            <p>
                I was able to detect the XSS attempt using Wireshark, a software for analyzing network traffic.
                The Javascript code was directly interpreted as input, and was thus run.
                To prevent this vulnerability, treating input as plaintext and filtering out &lt;script&gt; tags is necessary.
            </p>
